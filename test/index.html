  <p>This is some text and I will reference John 3:16.</p>
  <p>This is some more text and Acts 9-10 I will reference 1 Chron 2:22; 3:14; II Judges 2:21; Matt. 3:14 and 3rd Jn 1:5.</p>
  <p>Isa. 43:26; 1 Cor. 11:28, 31; 1 John 1:9; Phil. 3:13, 14; Prov. 1:23; Acts 1-9</p>
  <p>Confession of sins is not the basis of salvation. Jesus Christ was judged once for our sins, on the cross; and He does not need to be judged repeatedly for our sins. The basis of salvation is your personal trust in Christ and His work, rather than confession or any other act which you might perform to try to win the favor of God. Acts 16:31; John 1:12; Eph. 1:13, 14; 2:8, 9; 1 Pet. 2:24; 2 Cor. 5:21.</p>
